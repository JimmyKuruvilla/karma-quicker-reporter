# karma-quicker-reporter
A easier to read more flexible reporter plugin for Karma for use with Jasmine. 

#####Goals:

1. Useful information should be colorized 
2. Unnecessary information should be removed
3. When relevant, useful info should be diffed to highlight differences
4. Should be able to set config option to only report the first error - not fail fast - just minimize the output if you only want to see the first error.
5. Should still produce a normal Karma error even if everything else breaks.
